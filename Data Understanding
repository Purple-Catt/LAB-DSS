Assignment 1: Data Understanding
This task focuses on analyzing the structure and relationships between the three datasets (Crashes.csv, Vehicles.csv, and People.csv) and assessing the quality of the data, including identifying missing values. You also need to evaluate whether missing data can be filled and whether external data sources can be integrated to enhance the analysis.

1. Relationships Between the Three Files
The three datasets are related as follows:

Crashes.csv (Incidents):

This is the central table describing details of road incidents.
It has a unique identifier (RD_NO), which serves as the primary key to link with the other datasets.
Vehicles.csv (Vehicles):

Describes vehicles involved in each incident.
Contains RD_NO as a foreign key and also introduces VEHICLE_ID to uniquely identify each vehicle.
People.csv (People):

Describes people involved in accidents, such as drivers, passengers, or pedestrians.
Links to RD_NO to associate with crashes and uses VEHICLE_ID to relate people to specific vehicles.
Relationships Overview:
Crashes.csv: A single crash (RD_NO) may involve multiple vehicles and multiple people.
Vehicles.csv: A single vehicle may involve multiple people.
People.csv: A person can be linked to a vehicle or directly to a crash.
2. Missing Values
Crashes.csv
Some fields have missing values:
REPORT_TYPE and location-related fields such as LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, and LOCATION.
Missing geolocation data can potentially be filled using GIS services to derive coordinates from street names.
Vehicles.csv
Fields such as MAKE, MODEL, and VEHICLE_YEAR have missing values.
Missing data is often caused by unregistered vehicles or insufficient descriptions from reports.
External databases might help standardize and fill missing vehicle details.
People.csv
AGE, CITY, and STATE have significant missing values.
Demographic fields like AGE are challenging to recover due to a lack of precise sources.
3. Can Missing Data Be Recovered?
Possible Recoveries:

Geographical data: Missing latitude and longitude can be derived using external tools such as Google Maps API, Uber H3, or GeoHash, based on available street address information.
Weather conditions: Enrich the dataset with weather data from services like NOAA or OpenWeather based on the date and location of incidents.
Vehicle information: Use standardized vehicle databases to complete missing MAKE, MODEL, and VEHICLE_YEAR fields.
Difficult to Recover:

Demographic details: Fields such as AGE and SEX are difficult to fill without reliable external demographic data.
4. Integrating Additional Data
Hierarchical GeoHash/Uber H3/Google S2
GeoHash/Uber H3:
Useful for encoding crash locations into compact spatial indexes, enabling spatial analysis.
Google S2:
Provides accurate spatial indexing for analyzing incidents hierarchically.
Weather Data
Integrate weather conditions using public APIs such as NOAA or OpenWeather, allowing you to add:
Temperature.
Weather types (e.g., rain, fog, snow) based on crash date and location.
Road Characteristics
Enhance the dataset with information about road infrastructure, lighting, and signage quality, sourced from local traffic databases or government repositories.
5. Processing Strategy
Analyzing Relationships:

Link RD_NO across all datasets to build a cohesive schema.
Assess missing values and identify suitable recovery strategies.
GIS for Spatial Data:

Use external tools to fill missing location fields like LATITUDE and LONGITUDE.
Weather and Road Data Integration:

Add weather and road condition details based on crash time and location.
